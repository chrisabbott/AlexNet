(1) TRAINING A TINY IMAGENET CLASSIFIER FROM SCRATCH

To train a new classifier, "cd" into our submission
directory and execute the following commands:

make prepare-venv
source env/bin/activate
python train.py & 
python evaluate.py &
tensorboard --logdir=$(pwd)/logs

Then, open TensorBoard in your browser to monitor the
classifier's accuracy as it is being trained. You can
also monitor loss, mean-squared error, and other metrics.
